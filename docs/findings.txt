Ranking
    FWs get the most points consistently. 45% of all points are given to FWs. Followed by MFs (30%) and DFs (19%). GK gets 7%.
    If we take into account the number of players in the team on each position (most frequently, 1 GK, 4 DFs, 3MFs and 3FWs),  the ranking of positions is:
    1st FW
    2nd MF
    3rd GK
    4th DF
    
    If we look at specific players, instead of positions, the ranking of players by total votes is:
    1st Lamine
    2nd Fermin
    3rd-4th Gundogan/Joao Felix
    
    The next best midfielder is DeJong (5th). The first DF is Kounde (6th) and the next one is Araujo (9th).

    A team composed by the 11 players with most points would be:
    Ter Stegen (8th)Aunque no sea publico a√∫n, iria genial.
    Kounde (6th)
    Araujo (9th)
    Cancelo (10th)
    Gavi (7th)
    DeJong (5th)
    Gundogan (3rd/4th)
    Joao Felix (3rd/4th)
    Lamine (1st)
    Fermin (2nd)
    Lewandowski (11th)

        When GK plays well, DF does not.

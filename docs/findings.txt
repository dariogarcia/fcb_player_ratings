Ranking
    FWs get the most points consistently. 39% of all points are given to FWs. Followed by MFs (26.5%) and DFs (22.5%). GK gets 12%.
    If we take into account the number of players in the team on each position (most frequently, 1 GK, 4 DFs, 3MFs and 3FWs),  the ranking of positions is:
    1st FW 32.5% of votes
    2nd GK 30%
    3rd MF 22.5%
    4th DF 15%
    
    If we look at specific players, instead of positions, the ranking of players by total votes is:
    1st Ter Stegen
    2nd Lamine
    3rd Araujo
    
    The second best DF is Kounde (8th).
    The best midfielder is Gundogan (6th), and the next DeJong (7th). 
    The second best FW are Fermin and Joao Felix (4th/5th). 

    A team composed by the 11 players with most points would be:
    Ter Stegen (1st)
    Kounde (8th)
    Araujo (3rd)
    Cancelo (10th)
    Iñigo (16th)
    Gavi (9th)
    Gundogan (6th)
    DeJong (7th)
    Joao Felix (4th/5th)
    Lamine (2nd)
    Fermin (4th/5th)

    Iñigo (16th) could be replaced by Lewandowski (11th)

Apriori
    The strongest associations are {TerStegen->Gundogan} and {Araujo->Gavi->Gundogan}
    When GK plays well, DF does not.
